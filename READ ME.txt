Welcome to the Queuing simulator assignment test,

Sorry for the bad assets , i just pulled them out quickly, i dint want to submit a blank html and script file with no styling
Bad styling better than no styling ?? idk

All the required function have been implemented
The index.html file runs normally on the browser, no setup is required.
There are 3 different Queues, a Priority Q, 2 regular Qs for 2 separate counters, both counters serve the same Priority Q. they are implemented as (arrays)
there is also a priority list which is an array
no DB was used in this assignment

To Book a service, u should enter ur mobile phone(any number is ok) , choose a service and counter from drop-down lists
your mobile number will be added accordingly to a specific Q. only mobile numbers from the priority list with selected service as priority can be added to priority list

Below u can view any Q at anytime, or all Queues if u wish.

as requested Both Counter 1 and Counter 2 handle the priority service. Priority bookings should be served before other bookings, with a 2:1 ratio to avoid complete blocking of other customers in the other services. 

The priority list is adjustable with add,remove, and show functionalities added.

the initial priority list is as follows  ['11','22','33','44','55','66','77','88','99'].
